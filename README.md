Problem Statement

Airline Ticket price is influenced by a number of factors, such as flight duration, days left for departure, arrival time and departure time etc. Airline organizations may diminish the cost at the time they need to build the market and at the time when the tickets are less accessible. They may maximize the costs. The price may rely upon different factors. Each factor has its own proprietary rules and algorithms to set the price accordingly. Flyzy is trying to analyze the dataset to come up with trends and patterns that influence the ticket price so as to give the customers a better ticket booking experience. For example, they can offer insights into the optimal time for booking tickets to get the best prices, taking into account factors such as flight duration, days left for departure, and arrival/departure times. This helps customers make informed decisions and potentially save money. Additionally, Flyzy can develop pricing algorithms that consider various factors, allowing them to offer competitive and fair prices to customers. This ensures transparency and helps customers find the most suitable flights at the best possible prices, enhancing their overall booking experience.
